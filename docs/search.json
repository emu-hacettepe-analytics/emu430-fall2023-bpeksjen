It uses a vectors for operations on data frames and matrices.\n\nmy_vector &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\nmean_value &lt;- mean(my_vector)\nprint(mean_value)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nPython has a more general-purpose syntax with a clear, easy-to-read structure. It relies on libraries like NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation.\n\nimport numpy as np\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nmean_value = np.mean(my_list)\nprint(mean_value)\n\n3.0\n\n\nR offers unique data structures like data frames, which are well-suited for statistical analysis. It also uses factors for categorical data.\n\ndata_frame &lt;- data.frame(\n  Name = c(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"),\n  Age = c(25, 30, 22)\n)\n\nPython relies on a more extensive set of built-in data structures like lists, dictionaries, and tuples. Libraries like Pandas provide data frames.\n\nimport pandas as pd\ndata_frame = pd.DataFrame({\n  'Name': [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"],\n  'Age': [25, 30, 22]\n})\n\nIn R, list comprehensions are not a built-in feature of the language. Instead, R typically uses lapply() or sapply() functions to perform operations on lists.\n\nnumbers &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\nsquared_values &lt;- lapply(numbers, function(x) x^2)\nprint(squared_values)\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 1\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 4\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 9\n\n[[4]]\n[1] 16\n\n[[5]]\n[1] 25\n\n\nPython supports list comprehensions, which allow you to create lists using a concise and expressive syntax.\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nsquared_values = [x**2 for x in numbers]\nprint(squared_values)\n\n[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n\n\n\n\n2)\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
